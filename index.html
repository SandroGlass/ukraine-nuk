                        <p>Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Ukraine inherited the third-largest
                            nuclear arsenal in the world, with approximately 1,900 strategic nuclear warheads, 176
                            intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), and 44 strategic bombers.</p>

                        <p>In December 1994, Ukraine signed the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, agreeing to
                            give up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security assurances from Russia, the United
                            States, and the United Kingdom.</p>
                        <p>The signatories promised to respect Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and existing

                        <p>Ukraine began dismantling its strategic nuclear warheads and bomber fleet. The process
                            started with military nuclear facilities and strategic missile divisions.</p>
                        <p>By 1996, all strategic nuclear weapons had been transferred to Russia for dismantling.</p>

                        <p>Ukraine also gave up its tactical nuclear weapons and decommissioned nuclear warhead storage

                        <p>The invasion resulted in Russian occupation of additional Ukrainian territories in the east

                <p>Ukraine's journey from nuclear power to disarmament showcases both the promise and challenges of
                    international security agreements.</p>
                <p>The current conflict has led many to reconsider the implications of Ukraine's decision to relinquish
                    its nuclear arsenal and the reliability of security guarantees provided by global powers.</p>
